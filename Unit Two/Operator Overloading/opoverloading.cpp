/*
Operator overloading 

 * The general form of operator fucntion is:
 !  return-type classname:: operator op(){}

 * Operatar function must be  either: 
 ! 1. member function or friend function

 * The only difference btwn member and friend function is :
 ! Friend fucn have 1 argument for unary and 2 for binary 
 ! Member func have 0 argument for unary and 1 for binary
 because object used to call member function is passed implicitly
